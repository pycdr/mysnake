# mysnake
**mysnake** has some programs in different languages to show an animated snake in terminal!

the main idea is to write a small program in different language, as a practice or working with different languages.
# how to use
## Python
first, install [termpixels](https://github.com/loganzartman/termpixels) library, then run *snake.py* program:
```bash
pip3 install termpixels
python3 snake.py
```
## C
compile the *snake.c* file (suggection: *gcc*), then run the compiled file:
```bash
$ gcc snake.c -o snake
$ ./snake
```
## other languages
we will try to commit this program as other languages as soon as possible; also we will be happy to see you help us in any language you can, or anything else! :)
